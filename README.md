# humpday

In 2015 one of my kids started a family tradition when on a random Wednesday she texted me three camel emojis. 

I of course responded, "MikeMikeMikeMikeMike."

(Remember that old GEICO commercial with the camel walking through an office? He asked the people, "Guess what day it is?" He approached one guy with, "Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike!")

Since that day, my kids and I do this every Wednesday. Whoever thinks of it first will text some camel emojis, or a camel photo, or a camel meme. The recipient responds with MikeMikeMikeMikeMike, or a photo of someone named Mike, or a meme of someone named Mike.

This is an app that displays a list of all the people I need to text on Wednesdays, a grid display of camels, and a grid display of Mikes.
I want to be able to click on a name and choose which image to send -- a camel or a Mike -- and have it send the image as a text message.

It would be nice to save a history of which images I've sent each person. That way I won't end up sending the same ones two weeks in a row.

Yes, this is a silly app.

TO DO:

People
User can add people to contact list; use local storage.
User can edit names and phone numbers.
User can delete a person from contact list.

Make new person form look nicer.
Display list of contacts without the ID.


Camels and Mikes
What about gifs -- things with movement?
Photos are different sizes and orientations. Need to make carousels look nicer.
Can the user add camels and Mikes to the display?


Sending texts
User can click on a pic (camel or Mike) and see checkboxes with contact names. Can click boxes to text pic to those people.

I am not sure how the texting API works. Will it show the text coming from my phone number? Or something random? If not from my number, how will the recipient know who it's fromt?

When user submits the choice, I should somehow note on the person that they got their text for the week. Add a time/date stamp? A toggle that gets reset every week? Something else?
