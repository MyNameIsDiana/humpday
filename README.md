# humpday

In 2015 one of my kids started a family tradition when on a random Wednesday she texted me three camel emojis. 

I of course responded, "MikeMikeMikeMikeMike."

(Remember that old GEICO commercial with the camel walking through an office? He asked the people, "Guess what day it is?" He approached one guy with, "Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike!")

Since that day, my kids and I all do this every Wednesday. Whoever thinks of it first will text some camel emojis, or a camel photo, or a camel meme. The recipient responds with MikeMikeMikeMikeMike, or a photo of someone named Mike, or a meme of someone named Mike.

This is an app that displays a list of all the people I need to text on Wednesdays, a grid display of camels, and a grid display of Mikes.
I want to be able to click on a name and choose which image to send -- a camel or a Mike -- and have it send the image as a text message.

It would be nice to save a history of which images I've sent each person. That way I won't end up sending the same ones two weeks in a row.

Yes, this is a silly app.
